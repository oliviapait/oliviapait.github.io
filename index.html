			<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Olivia Pait. I was born in Hartsville, South Carolina. I am twenty-three years old and have two older brothers. I have two dogs named Ollie and Copper who I love very much and enjoy spoiling. I rescued Copper in 2019 when I moved away for college he is now five years old. Ollie was "rescued" from Craigslist in 2021 and he is two years old. They help keep me active and very entertained.</p>

		<p id="more" class="hidden" >&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I grew up in Murrells Inlet, SC. I attended Waccamaw High School in Pawleys Island, SC. I graduated high school in 2018. I got into Clemson and USC but decided to go to Midlands Technical College before transferring to the University of South Carolina for spring 2019. I did early walk for USC in May 2023 and I am finishing up my final required course this summer. My major at the University of South Carolina is sociology.</p>

			<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>

		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am unsure of my future career plans. I currently work at Outback Steakhouse in Murrells Inlet, SC. I hostess and serve at my job now. I plan to use the next year to save up money and decide what I would like to do with my career in the future. I love school and learning but want to be sure to take the time and decide what I want to do for my next step. In the meantime, I am going to work my job at home in close proximity to my mom and grandma who I help often. </p>

		<p id="mores" class="hidden" >&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
In the next year, I am going to weigh my options for considering attending graduate school. Some options I have considered are law school or vet school. I have always loved animals very much and love taking care of my pets so I think I could make a good veterinarian. Law is also a subject that very much interests me and I think would make a good career choice. Most importantly I am undecided on my future career plans. Therefore, I am going to spend some time reflecting on the best choices for myself and my future.</p>
